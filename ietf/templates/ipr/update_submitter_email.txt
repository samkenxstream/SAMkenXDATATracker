Subject: IPR update notification
Reply-To: {{ reply_to }}

Dear {{ to_name }}:

We have just received a request to update one or more IPR disclosures
previously submitted by you:

{% for ipr in iprs %}
{{ ipr.title }} {{ ipr.get_absolute_url }}
{% endfor %}

The name and email address of the person who submitted the update to
your IPR disclosure are: {{ new_ipr.submitter_name }}, {{ new_ipr.submitter_email }}.
If this is you or someone known by you to be authorized to update
the above disclosures, please respond to this message to confirm.

We will not post this update unless we receive positive confirmation
from you that the update is indeed from you or someone authorized to
update the above listed disclosures.

If we do not hear from you within 30 days, we will inform {{ new_ipr.submitter_name }}
that we were not able to secure approval for posting and that we are
therefore rejecting the update until we can be assured it is authorized.

Thank you

IETF Secretariat
